## Usage

The usage of the app is fairly simple, you need to have python installed. In addition to that you need to install a python library called 'customtkinter'. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal.

```javascript
pip install customtkinter
```

Afterwards, just open the 'OpenWeatherMonitor.py' file in an IDE or text editor of your choice, and execute the file. This will open the weather app's GUI.
